The blue check on the profile helps confirm this TikTok URL is owned and operated by Coca-Cola.
* '[Taylor Swift](https://golden.com/wiki/Taylor_Swift-VKZ3DY5)' -> 'TikTok URL' -> 'https://www.tiktok.com/@taylorswift' would be correct, as this is the primary and official TikTok account of Taylor Swift. The blue check helps confirm it is officially owned and operated by Taylor Swift.
