# Predicate Name
Source Code URL

# Label
URL to this entity's source code

# Description
The primary, official source code URL associated with this entity. Source code URLs may often be Github URLs, but do not always have to be. The source code URL should point to the source code specifically associated with the entity, not a product of the entity, a parent organization of the entity, etc. For example, https://github.com/facebook/react would be an appropriate source code URL for React, but not for Facebook, the parent organization of React.
