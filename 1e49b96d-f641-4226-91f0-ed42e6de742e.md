# Description
The primary, official source code URL associated with this entity. The primary and official source code URL should not be a fork off of a more primary and official version.

Source code URLs may often be Github URLs, but do not always have to be. The source code URL should point to the source code specifically associated with the entity, not a product of the entity, a parent organization of the entity, etc.

# Example of Proper Usage
* '[React](https://golden.com/wiki/React-DYD3ZA)' -> 'Source Code URL' -> 'https://github.com/facebook/react' is correct, as this is the primary and official source code URL for React (the version history and number of watchers/forks/stars are useful proxies to help confirm this)
* '[Solidity](https://golden.com/wiki/Solidity-DWBADB)' -> 'Source Code URL' -> 'https://github.com/ethereum/solidity' is correct, as this is the primary and official source code URL for React (the version history and number of watchers/forks/stars are useful proxies to help confirm this)

# Example of Improper Usage
* '[React](https://golden.com/wiki/React-DYD3ZA)' -> 'Source Code URL' -> 'https://github.com/facebook' is incorrect, as while https://github.com/facebook has a repository containing React's primary and official source code, https://github.com/facebook is not itself a direct link to React's source code.
* '[React](https://golden.com/wiki/React-DYD3ZA)' -> 'Source Code URL' -> 'https://github.com/Hacker0x01/react-datepicker' is incorrect, as 'https://github.com/Hacker0x01/react-datepicker' is a package built for React applications, but not the primary and official React source code URL.
* '[Solidity](https://golden.com/wiki/Solidity-DWBADB)' -> 'Source Code URL' -> 'https://github.com/ethereum/solidity-blog' is incorrect, as while this source code URL is officially associated with Solidity as its blog, it is not the primary source code URL
