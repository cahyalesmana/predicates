## Example of Proper Usage
* ‘[Ginkgo Bioworks](https://golden.com/wiki/Ginkgo_Bioworks-GE8DBAJ)’ → ‘DUNS number’ → ‘827811626’ is correct, as this DUNS number matches the Ginkgo Bioworks organization

## Example of Improper Usage
* '[Amazon](https://golden.com/wiki/Amazon_(company)-B6VEMY)' → 'DUNS number' → '083448961' is incorrect, as this DUNS number matches ['Amazon Web Services (AWS)'](https://golden.com/wiki/Amazon_Web_Services_(AWS)-MNM533). AWS is a subsidiary of Amazon and thus has a different DUNS number - Amazon's actual DUNS number is '884745530'.
