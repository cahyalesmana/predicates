## Example of Proper Usage:
* '[Frontline Clinician Psilocybin Study](https://golden.com/wiki/Frontline_Clinician_Psilocybin_Study-EKGJPNW)' → 'Trial Recruitment Size' → '30' is correct, citation: https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT05163496.

## Example of Improper Usage:
* '[Frontline Clinician Psilocybin Study](https://golden.com/wiki/Frontline_Clinician_Psilocybin_Study-EKGJPNW)' → 'Trial Recruitment Size' → '25' is incorrect, as this is the size of the dosage of the treatment.  Trial Recruitment Size is the number of participants (people) enrolled in the trial.
