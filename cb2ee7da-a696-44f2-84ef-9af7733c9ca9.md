## Example of Improper Usage:
* '[ECoG BMI for Motor and Speech Control](https://golden.com/wiki/ECoG_BMI_for_Motor_and_Speech_Control-39ZYX96)' → 'Trial Recruitment Status' → 'Not yet recruiting' is incorrect, citation: https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03698149. Trial Recruitment Status should be obtained from the official clinical trial record rather than a source (such as press release, news article) that may be out of date.
