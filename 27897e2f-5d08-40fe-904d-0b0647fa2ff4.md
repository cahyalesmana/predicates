# Description
The primary and official contact page URL for an entity, such as but not limited to a link to a contact form, a website with aggregate contact details. A URL whose main purpose is not to provide contact details but happens to have some contact information on it should not be used. A social URL should not function as the primary and official contact page URL for an entity.

# Example of Proper Usage
* '[Catalent](https://golden.com/wiki/Catalent-BW8E8KG)' -> 'Contact Page URL' -> 'https://www.catalent.com/contact-us/' would be correct, as this is a contact page URL located on catalent's official domain.

# Example of Improper Usage
* [Marc Andreessen](https://golden.com/wiki/Marc_Andreessen-DBY)' -> 'Contact Page URL' -> 'https://twitter.com/pmarca' would be incorrect, as a twitter URL does not function as the official contact page URL for an entity.
