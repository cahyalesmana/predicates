# Description
The primary and official Angellist profile URL associated with this entity. The URL should ideally point towards the company's overview page (i.e. https://angel.co/company/<company_name>) and not another view (such as https://angel.co/company/<company_name>/jobs)

# Example of Proper Usage
* '[Jeff Clavier](https://golden.com/wiki/Jeff_Clavier-DBEDM8A)' -> 'Angellist URL' -> 'https://angel.co/p/jeff' is correct, as this is the primary and official Angellist account associated with Jeff Clavier.
* '[Golden](https://golden.com/wiki/Golden-5R)' -> 'Angellist URL' -> 'https://angel.co/company/golden' is correct, as this is the primary and official Angellist account of Golden.

# Example of Improper Usage
* '[Jeff Clavier](https://golden.com/wiki/Jeff_Clavier-DBEDM8A)' -> 'Angellist URL' -> 'https://angel.co/company/softtech-vc' is incorrect, as this is a Angellist URL associated with a fund that Jeff Clavier is the founder of, but the primary and official Angellist URL associated with Jeff Clavier himself.
